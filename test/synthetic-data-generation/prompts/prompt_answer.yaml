Here is a sample document, question and an answer for your reference.\n[Start of Document]Chapter: Architecture and technical overview Subsubsection: On-chip L3 cache and intelligent caching \n\uf0b7 The Power10 processor includes a large on-chip L3 cache of up to 120 MB with a NUCA architecture that provides mechanisms to distribute and share cache footprints across a set of L3 cache regions. Each processor core can access an associated local 8 MB of L3 cache. It can also access the data in the other L3 cache regions on the chip and throughout the system. Each L3 region serves as a victim cache for its associated L2 cache and can provide aggregate storage for the on-chip cache footprint. Intelligent L3 cache management enables the Power10 processor to optimize the access to L3 cache lines and minimize cache latencies. The L3 includes a replacement algorithm with data type and reuse awareness. It also supports an array of prefetch requests from the core, including instruction and data, and works cooperatively with the core, memory controller, and SMP interconnection fabric to manage prefetch traffic, which optimizes system throughput and data latency.[End of Document]\n[Start of Question]What kinda caching mechanism does the Power10 processor have?[End of Question]\n[Start of Answer]The Power10 processor uses a large on-chip L3 cache of up to 120 MB based on a NUCA (Non-Uniform Cache Access) architecture that distributes cache regions across the chip. Each core has fast access to a local 8 MB slice of the L3 cache while still being able to access other L3 regions on the processor and across the system. The L3 cache regions act as victim caches for their associated L2 caches, improving effective cache capacity and data reuse. Intelligent cache management optimizes cache line placement and access by using replacement policies that are aware of data type and reuse behavior. The caching mechanism also includes coordinated instruction and data prefetching that works with the core, memory controller, and SMP interconnect to reduce latency and improve overall throughput.[End of Answer]\n[Start of Document]{{document}}[End of Document]\n[Start of Question]{{question}}[End of Question]\n.
