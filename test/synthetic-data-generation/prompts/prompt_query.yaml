The answer to the question should be present in the provided document. If you are unable to generate such a question then generate \"NOT APPLICABLE\". The question should not be more than 50 words. Here is a sample document and a question for your reference.\n[Start of Document]Chapter: Architecture and technical overview Subsubsection: On-chip L3 cache and intelligent caching \n\uf0b7 The Power10 processor includes a large on-chip L3 cache of up to 120 MB with a NUCA architecture that provides mechanisms to distribute and share cache footprints across a set of L3 cache regions. Each processor core can access an associated local 8 MB of L3 cache. It can also access the data in the other L3 cache regions on the chip and throughout the system. Each L3 region serves as a victim cache for its associated L2 cache and can provide aggregate storage for the on-chip cache footprint. Intelligent L3 cache management enables the Power10 processor to optimize the access to L3 cache lines and minimize cache latencies. The L3 includes a replacement algorithm with data type and reuse awareness. It also supports an array of prefetch requests from the core, including instruction and data, and works cooperatively with the core, memory controller, and SMP interconnection fabric to manage prefetch traffic, which optimizes system throughput and data latency.[End of Document]\n[Start of Question]What kinda caching mechanism does the Power10 processor have?[End of Question]\n[Start of Document]{{document}}[End of Document].
